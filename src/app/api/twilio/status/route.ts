/**
 * Receives Twilio call + recording status callbacks.
 *
 * This route is the system's source of truth for what a phone is actually doing.
 * Twilio is the only party that knows whether a human picked up — ElevenLabs
 * cannot tell us, because in bridge mode it is talking to our own Twilio
 * conference, which answers instantly. We used to subscribe to these events and
 * then throw the interesting ones away, which is why a call that rang out sat in
 * the Live Monitor as "In Progress" until something force-closed it minutes later.
 *
 * Three jobs:
 *   1. AI calls  — drive the conversation lifecycle (ringing → connected →
 *      no-answer), and hang up the AI agent when nobody answers.
 *   2. Human calls — drive `live_calls` presence, so the monitor no longer depends
 *      on the rep's browser tab staying alive.
 *   3. Recordings + parallel-dial winner selection (pre-existing).
